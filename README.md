## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

> cd my-folder
> git clone git@github.com:myaccount/my-project.git

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- gitHub account;
- git installed on your OS.

### Instructions 

- Create a new GitHub repository for this exercise.

#### Task 1
- Write a function *stringLength(string)* that takes any string as an argument and returns its characters count.
- Now write a test for this function.
- Next, expand your function to make it check if the string is at least 1 character long and not longer than 10 characters. Throw errors if those conditions are not met.
- Add tests for the new functionality.

#### Task 2
- Write a function *reverseString(string)* function. It should take a string as an argument and return it reversed.
- Write at least one test for this function.

#### Task 3
In this task, you will need to write several tests for each tested function. You could write all of your tests directly at the top level, but it's better to group related tests so their output is more readable. *Jest* has the `describe()` method just for that. Read about it [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#describename-fn) and apply it in your tests for this task:

- Write a simple *calculator* class or object, which will have 4 methods: *add*, *subtract*, *divide*, and *multiply*.
- Write at least 3 tests for each of the calculator methods.
- Group tests for each method using `describe()` method.

#### Task 4 
In this task we're going to do things differently:
- Start by writing a test for a *capitalize(string)* function. Your test should make sure that this function takes a string as an argument and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
- Run your test - it should fail because you don’t have the *capitalize(string)* function implemented yet.
- Now make your tests green by implementing the *capitalize(string)* function. Think about what the minimum amount of code is necessary to pass this test and write it.

Congratulations! In task 4, you have just used the TDD approach for development by writing tests before writing the actual functions. Note the difference in the steps you followed here, compared with those you used in the previous 3 tasks. Don't worry if this last strategy looks counterintuitive or strange at the moment, we will do several more TDD examples in the next module.

### Usage

You can use this project by cloning it to your folder and changing index.html and styles.css files.
